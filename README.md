# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, I am currently living in the silicon valley and I am very excited. I am obtaining a lot of knowledge and motivation. Being out here showed me what it takes to succeed in my software field. I am saying "my software field" because I will be one of the best at implementing new programs for users. I am the future.
